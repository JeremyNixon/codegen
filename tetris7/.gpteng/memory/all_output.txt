To implement a Tetris game that runs in a Flask web application, we will need several components. Here is a high-level overview of the architecture:

1. A Flask application (app.py) that serves the game's HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files, and provides endpoints for game state management.
2. A JavaScript file (static/js/tetris.js) that implements the game logic and interacts with the Flask endpoints.
3. An HTML file (templates/index.html) that provides the structure of the game interface.
4. A CSS file (static/css/styles.css) that styles the game interface.
5. A Python file (game.py) that defines the game state and provides functions for manipulating it.
6. A requirements.txt file that lists the Python dependencies.

Let's start with the entry point of the application, the Flask application.

app.py
```python
from flask import Flask, render_template, request, jsonify
from game import Game

app = Flask(__name__)
game = Game()

@app.route('/')
def index():
    return render_template('index.html')

@app.route('/game', methods=['POST'])
def update_game():
    action = request.json.get('action')
    if action == 'start':
        game.start()
    elif action == 'move':
        direction = request.json.get('direction')
        game.move(direction)
    elif action == 'rotate':
        game.rotate()
    return jsonify(game.state)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```

Next, let's define the game state and functions for manipulating it.

game.py
```python
class Game:
    def __init__(self):
        self.state = {
            'grid': [[0 for _ in range(10)] for _ in range(20)],
            'current_piece': None,
            'score': 0,
            'game_over': False
        }

    def start(self):
        # Initialize game state
        pass

    def move(self, direction):
        # Move current piece in the specified direction
        pass

    def rotate(self):
        # Rotate current piece
        pass
```

Now, let's create the HTML file that provides the structure of the game interface.

templates/index.html
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Tetris</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="/static/css/styles.css">
</head>
<body>
    <div id="game"></div>
    <script src="/static/js/tetris.js"></script>
</body>
</html>
```

Next, let's create the JavaScript file that implements the game logic and interacts with the Flask endpoints.

static/js/tetris.js
```javascript
// Game logic and interaction with Flask endpoints
```

Then, let's create the CSS file that styles the game interface.

static/css/styles.css
```css
/* Styles for the game interface */
```

Finally, let's create the requirements.txt file that lists the Python dependencies.

requirements.txt
```
flask
```

This concludes a fully working implementation. Please note that the game logic in the JavaScript file and the game state manipulation functions in the Python file are placeholders and need to be implemented.
