To implement a Tetris game that runs in a Flask web application, we will need several components. Here is a high-level overview of the architecture:

- A Flask application that serves the game's HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.
- A JavaScript file that implements the Tetris game logic and interacts with the HTML and CSS to display the game.
- HTML and CSS files to define and style the game's user interface.
- A Python file to define the Flask application and routes.

Let's start with the Flask application. We'll create a simple Flask application that serves static files.

app/main.py
