To implement a Tetris game that runs in a Flask web application, we will need several components. Here is a high-level overview of the architecture:

- A Flask application that serves the game's HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.
- A JavaScript file that implements the Tetris game logic and interacts with the HTML and CSS to display the game.
- HTML and CSS files to define and style the game's user interface.
- A Python file to define the Flask application and routes.

Let's start with the Flask application. We'll create a simple Flask application that serves static files.

app/main.py
```python
from flask import Flask, send_from_directory

app = Flask(__name__, static_folder='static')

@app.route('/')
def index():
    return send_from_directory(app.static_folder, 'index.html')

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```

Next, we'll create the HTML file for the game. This file will include a canvas element where the game will be displayed, and it will include the game's JavaScript and CSS files.

app/static/index.html
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Tetris</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="styles.css">
</head>
<body>
    <canvas id="game" width="320" height="640"></canvas>
    <script src="tetris.js"></script>
</body>
</html>
```

Now, we'll create the CSS file for the game. This file will style the canvas element.

app/static/styles.css
```css
body {
    display: flex;
    justify-content: center;
    align-items: center;
    height: 100vh;
    background: black;
    margin: 0;
}

#game {
    border: 1px solid white;
}
```

Finally, we'll create the JavaScript file for the game. This file will implement the Tetris game logic and interact with the canvas element to display the game. This is a simplified version of Tetris and does not include all features of the game.

app/static/tetris.js
```javascript
const canvas = document.getElementById('game');
const context = canvas.getContext('2d');

const grid = 20;
let tetromino = [[1, 1, 1, 1]];
let tetrominoX = 5;
let tetrominoY = 0;

function update() {
    context.clearRect(0, 0, canvas.width, canvas.height);

    for (let row = 0; row < tetromino.length; row++) {
        for (let col = 0; col < tetromino[row].length; col++) {
            if (tetromino[row][col]) {
                context.fillStyle = 'white';
                context.fillRect((tetrominoX + col) * grid, (tetrominoY + row) * grid, grid - 1, grid - 1);
            }
        }
    }

    if (tetrominoY < canvas.height / grid - tetromino.length) {
        tetrominoY++;
    }

    setTimeout(update, 1000);
}

update();
```

To run the application, you need to install Flask. You can do this by creating a requirements.txt file with the following content:

requirements.txt
```txt
Flask==1.1.2
```

You can then install the required packages with the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

And run the application with the following command:

```bash
python -m app.main
```

This concludes a fully working implementation.
