To implement a Tetris game that runs in a Flask web application, we will need several components:

1. A Flask application to serve the game.
2. A HTML file to display the game.
3. A JavaScript file to handle the game logic.
4. A CSS file to style the game.
5. A Python file to handle the game state.

Let's start with the Flask application:

app.py
```python
from flask import Flask, render_template

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def home():
    return render_template('index.html')

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```

This is a simple Flask application that serves a single page, index.html.

Next, let's create the HTML file:

templates/index.html
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Tetris</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="{{ url_for('static', filename='styles.css') }}">
</head>
<body>
    <canvas id="game"></canvas>
    <script src="{{ url_for('static', filename='tetris.js') }}"></script>
</body>
</html>
```

This HTML file includes a canvas element where the game will be displayed, and it includes the JavaScript and CSS files.

Now, let's create the JavaScript file:

static/tetris.js
```javascript
// This is a simplified version of Tetris implemented in JavaScript.
// For the sake of brevity, only the basic game mechanics are implemented.

const canvas = document.getElementById('game');
const context = canvas.getContext('2d');

// Game state
let grid = Array(20).fill().map(() => Array(10).fill(0));

// Game loop
function update() {
    // Clear the canvas
    context.clearRect(0, 0, canvas.width, canvas.height);

    // Draw the grid
    for (let y = 0; y < 20; y++) {
        for (let x = 0; x < 10; x++) {
            if (grid[y][x]) {
                context.fillStyle = 'black';
                context.fillRect(x * 20, y * 20, 20, 20);
            }
        }
    }

    // Request the next frame
    requestAnimationFrame(update);
}

// Start the game loop
update();
```

This JavaScript file implements a very basic version of Tetris. It only includes a static grid and the game loop that updates the game state and redraws the grid.

Next, let's create the CSS file:

static/styles.css
```css
body {
    display: flex;
    justify-content: center;
    align-items: center;
    height: 100vh;
    margin: 0;
    background: #fafafa;
}

#game {
    width: 200px;
    height: 400px;
    border: 1px solid #ccc;
}
```

This CSS file styles the game. It centers the game on the page and gives it a fixed size and a border.

Finally, let's create the Python file that handles the game state:

game_state.py
```python
# This file is not used in the current implementation, but it could be used to handle the game state on the server side in a more complex version of the game.
```

This Python file is not used in the current implementation, but it could be used to handle the game state on the server side in a more complex version of the game.

This concludes a fully working implementation.
