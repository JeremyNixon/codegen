To implement a Tetris game that runs in a Flask web application, we will need several components:

1. A Flask application to serve the game.
2. A JavaScript file to handle the game logic.
3. An HTML file to display the game.
4. A CSS file to style the game.
5. A Python file to handle the game state.

Let's start with the Flask application.
