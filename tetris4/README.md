To implement a Tetris game that runs in a Flask web application, we will need several components. Here is a high-level overview of the architecture:

1. A Flask application (`app.py`) that serves the game's HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files, and handles game state updates via AJAX requests.
2. A Tetris game logic module (`tetris.py`) that handles the game's logic, such as moving and rotating pieces, checking for line clears, and game over conditions.
3. HTML (`index.html`), CSS (`styles.css`), and JavaScript (`script.js`) files for the game's frontend. The JavaScript file will handle user input and communicate with the Flask application to update the game state.
4. A `requirements.txt` file to specify the Python dependencies.

Let's start with the Flask application:

app.py
