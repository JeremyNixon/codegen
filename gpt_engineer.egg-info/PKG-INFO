**Specify what you want it to build, the AI asks for clarification, and then builds it.**

GPT Engineer is made to be easy to adapt, extend, and make your agent learn how you want your code to look. It generates an entire codebase based on a prompt.

- [Demo](https://twitter.com/antonosika/status/1667641038104674306)

## Project philosophy

- Simple to get value
- Flexible and easy to add new own "AI steps". See `steps.py`.
- Incrementally build towards a user experience of:
  1. high level prompting
  2. giving feedback to the AI that it will remember over time
- Fast handovers, back and forth, between AI and human
- Simplicity, all computation is "resumable" and persisted to the filesystem

## Setup

Choose either **stable** or **development**.

For **stable** release:

- `python -m pip install gpt-engineer`

For **development**:
- `git clone https://github.com/AntonOsika/gpt-engineer.git`
- `cd gpt-engineer`
- `python -m pip install -e .`
  - (or: `make install && source venv/bin/activate` for a venv)

**API Key**

Choose **one** of:
- Export env variable (you can add this to .bashrc so that you don't have to do it each time you start the terminal)
    - `export OPENAI_API_KEY=[your api key]`
- .env file:
    - Create a copy of `.env.template` named `.env`
    - Add your OPENAI_API_KEY in .env
- Custom model:
    - See [docs](https://gpt-engineer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/open_models.html), supports local model, azure, etc.

Check the [Windows README](./WINDOWS_README.md) for windows usage.

## Usage

There are two ways to work with GPT-engineer: new code mode (the default), and improve existing code mode (the `-i` option).

### Creating new code
- Create an empty folder for your project anywhere on your computer
- Create a file called `prompt` (no extension) inside your new folder and fill it with instructions
- Run `gpt-engineer <project_dir>` with a relative path to your folder
  - For example: `gpt-engineer projects/my-new-project` from the gpt-engineer directory root with your new folder in `projects/`

### Improving Existing Code
- Locate a folder with code which you want to improve anywhere on your computer
- Create a file called `prompt` (no extension) inside your new folder and fill it with instructions for how you want to improve the code
- Run `gpt-engineer <project_dir> -i` with a relative path to your folder
  - For example: `gpt-engineer projects/my-old-project` from the gpt-engineer directory root with your folder in `projects/`

By running gpt-engineer you agree to our [terms](https://github.com/AntonOsika/gpt-engineer/blob/main/TERMS_OF_USE.md).

**Results**

Check the generated files in `projects/my-new-project/workspace`

**Workflow**

`gpt-engineer --help` lets you see all available options.

For example:

- To improve any existing project, use the flag: `-i`
- To give feedback to/improve a gpt-engineer generated project, use: `--steps use_feedback`
- To use or prepare project specific preprompt files, use `--use-custom-preprompts`

**Alternatives**

You can check [Docker instructions](docker/README.md) to use Docker, or simply
do everything in your browser:

[![Open in GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces/badge.svg)](https://github.com/AntonOsika/gpt-engineer/codespaces)

## Features

You can specify the "identity" of the AI agent by editing the files in the `preprompts` folder.

Editing the `preprompts`, and evolving how you write the project prompt, is how you make the agent remember things between projects.

You can also automatically copy all `preprompts` files into your project folder using the cli parameter `--use-custom-prepompts`. This way you can have custom preprompts for all of your projects without the need to edit the main files. If you don't want to use the project specific prepromt files, simply delete them or run `gpt-engineer` without the cli param.

Each step in `steps.py` will have its communication history with GPT4 stored in the logs folder, and can be rerun with `scripts/rerun_edited_message_logs.py`.

You can also run with open source models, like WizardCoder. See the [documentation](https://gpt-engineer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/open_models.html) for example instructions.

## Vision

The gpt-engineer community is building the **open platform for devs to tinker with and build their personal code-generation toolbox**.

If you are interested in contributing to this, we would be interested in having you.

If you want to see our broader ambitions, check out the [roadmap](https://github.com/AntonOsika/gpt-engineer/blob/main/ROADMAP.md), and join
[discord](https://discord.gg/8tcDQ89Ej2)
to get input on how you can [contribute](.github/CONTRIBUTING.md) to it.

We are currently looking for more maintainers and community organizers. Email anton.osika@gmail.com if you are interested in an official role.
