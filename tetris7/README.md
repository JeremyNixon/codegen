To implement a Tetris game that runs in a Flask web application, we will need several components. Here is a high-level overview of the architecture:

1. A Flask application (app.py) that serves the game's HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files, and provides endpoints for game state management.
2. A JavaScript file (static/js/tetris.js) that implements the game logic and interacts with the Flask endpoints.
3. An HTML file (templates/index.html) that provides the structure of the game interface.
4. A CSS file (static/css/styles.css) that styles the game interface.
5. A Python file (game.py) that defines the game state and provides functions for manipulating it.
6. A requirements.txt file that lists the Python dependencies.

Let's start with the entry point of the application, the Flask application.
