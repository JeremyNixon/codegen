To implement a Tetris game that runs in a Flask web application, we will need several components:

1. A Flask application to serve the game and handle requests.
2. A JavaScript file to handle the game logic on the client side.
3. HTML and CSS files to display the game in the browser.
4. A Python file to define the game logic on the server side.

Let's start with the Flask application.
