To implement a Tetris game that runs in a Flask web application, we will need several components. Here are the core classes and functions we will need:

1. `TetrisGame`: This class will handle the game logic, such as moving and rotating tetrominoes, checking for line clears, and ending the game.

2. `Tetromino`: This class will represent a single tetromino. It will have methods for rotating the tetromino.

3. `Board`: This class will represent the game board. It will have methods for adding a tetromino to the board and checking for line clears.

4. `app.py`: This is the main Flask application file. It will handle routing and serve the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.

5. `index.html`: This is the main HTML file. It will contain the game board and controls.

6. `styles.css`: This file will contain the CSS styles for the game.

7. `script.js`: This file will contain the JavaScript code that interacts with the Flask server and updates the game board in the browser.

8. `requirements.txt`: This file will list the Python dependencies for the project.

Let's start with the Python files:

app.py
